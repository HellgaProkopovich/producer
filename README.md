# Producer Landing Page
This project is a landing page for a producer, developed as a team in May. We built the project with a component-based approach, splitting the work into sections and shared UI components to speed up the process and keep the codebase clean.

The result of the work here: [glebpetrov.vh78.hosterby.com](glebpetrov.vh78.hosterby.com)

## What was done overall
- Built core UI components: buttons, containers, titles, icons, etc.
- Developed key sections: Header, MainSection, AboutSection, ServicesSection, CasesSection, ContactForm, and Footer.
- Implemented responsive design for mobile devices.
- Integrated SVG icons using vite-plugin-svg-icons.
- Added form validation with Vuelidate.

## My contributions
- Implemented and adapted AboutSection and ServicesSection, including complex backgrounds and element alignments.
- Refactored the TitlesContainer component: added slot support and flexible title alignment (left/right).
